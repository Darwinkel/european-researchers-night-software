I have read and understood the information about the research project and I voluntarily agree to participate. I know whom to contact in case I have questions and I have been informed about my rights.

I understand that I can withdraw at any time, without giving a reason.

I understand that taking part in the study involves interacting with an AI agent.

That the data collected through the games that I provide will be deposited in DataverseNL so that it can be used for future research and learning.
