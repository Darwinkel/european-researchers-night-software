<h1>Task 4: Rating the model's reconstruction of the system's random shuffle</h1>
<p class="fw-italic">Sample - {{ sample_id }} </p>

This task is identical to the previous one, except that the story has been shuffled completely randomly by the system.

Your task is to rate how well the model has reconstructed the story on the same three points as before:

<h4>Flow</h4>
How well has the model reconstructed the story?
A score of 0 means that the model has made many mistakes or produced garbage output, while a score of 10 means that the model has successfully reconstructed the logical ordering of the story.

<h4>Fluency</h4>
It is possible that the model rewrote (some parts of) the story in a way that is grammatically incorrect or awkward.
A score of 0 means that the model has made many mistakes or produced garbage output.
A score of 10 means that the model has made minimal modifications, perhaps appropriately correcting a typo or two.

<h4>Accuracy</h4>
The factual accuracy of the story. That is, did the model add or remove information that was not present in the original story?
A score of 0 means that the model has fabricated information, while a score of 10 means that the model has not added or removed any information.
